## some content, yo!

this is a test of some content

it's _really_ cool

it even supports code: `<html>`

OK -- so this _is_ finally getting somewhere!

TODO

* make sure the editing experience is nice (maybe compare with medium >_<)
* add the content optimization pipeline, and allow uploading images/drag-n-drop
* add post previews -- possibly using websockets to do live updates
* oh, and add hanging punctuation.
	- here's an inner list...
* add authentication
* maybe add `git` support?
* flash messages

[typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) is a good starting point.

Oh, are em dashes handled properly? I just want to make sure - they're a major part of writing. Here's an example with a -- double dash. Of course, we also have to check that "quotes" are handled properly. And ellipsis? Well...
