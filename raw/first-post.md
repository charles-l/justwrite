## some content, yo!

this is a test of some content

it's _really_ cool

it even supports code: `<html>`

OK -- so this _is_ finally getting somewhere!

TODO

* ~~make sure the editing experience is nice (maybe compare with medium >_<)~~
* add the content optimization pipeline, and allow uploading images/drag-n-drop
* oh, and add hanging punctuation.
	- here's an inner list... (TODO: fixme)
* add authentication
* flash messages
* add ability to choose a hero image
* make nice code rendering
* make index page nicer
    * allow users to add a blurb, show contact info, etc
* add author metadata
* bundle things into a single executable
    * make executable nice to work with

## v2 (probably)

* maybe add `git` support?
* add post previews -- possibly using websockets to do live updates
* make admin interface nicer (check if logged in, add edit button to posts?)
* add metrics page (track user log-ins etc)
* add auto https (unless this is needed to secure admin login...)
* add stripe or donate button support?
* oauth?


[typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) is a good starting point.

Oh, are em dashes handled properly? I just want to make sure - they're a major part of writing. Here's an example with a -- double dash. Of course, we also have to check that "quotes" are handled properly. And ellipsis? Well...
